RoseStacker is a plugin that allows you to stack mobs, items, spawners, and blocks. The purpose of the plugin is to add cool and new functionality to your server, and to alleviate common sources of server lag through minimizing the loaded entities and items in your worlds.

### Documentation
Any and all information you need for the plugin should already be included [in our Wiki](https://github.com/Rosewood-Development/RoseStacker/wiki)!

### Support
If there's anything we left out, you have a question, you want to report a bug, or anything else, please [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MgUsTBK).  We offer any and all support in our server.

### Server Compatibility
RoseStacker is compatible with Spigot and any forks. We recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io/) to run your server.  CraftBukkit servers will not be compatible with the plugin.

We support Minecraft versions **1.16.5** and newer running **Java 17**.

If you wish to use this plugin on a 1.16.5 server (newer versions do not need this), you will need to use [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (or a fork of Paper), Java 17, and add the flag `-DPaper.IgnoreJavaVersion=true` to your server's startup parameters.
